## Vanguard Adjustments

### Thor

The God of Thunder's presence in team fights was underwhelming, so we've implemented the following buffs:

| Stat | Change |
|------|--------|
| Mjolnir Throw | Damage 80 → 95 |
| Thunderstrike | Range 8m → 10m |
| Bifrost | Cooldown 15s → 12s |

### Hulk

Hulk was slightly overtuned, so we've made minor adjustments:

- Ground Pound CC duration reduced from **1.2s → 1.0s**
- Gamma Charge movement speed reduced by **5%**

## Duelist Adjustments

### Storm

Storm's area damage capabilities have been enhanced:

- Lightning Bolt charge time reduced by **20%**
- Wind Rider duration extended from **4s → 5s**

### Magneto

- Metal Debris projectile speed increased by **15%**
- Magnetic Barrier absorption increased from **500 → 600**

## Looking Ahead

The development team will continue gathering player feedback and making balance adjustments to ensure the most enjoyable gaming experience possible.
