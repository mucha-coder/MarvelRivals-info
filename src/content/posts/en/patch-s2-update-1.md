## Hero Balance Changes

### Iron Man

Iron Man's long-range damage output was too dominant, so we've made the following adjustments:

| Stat | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Repulsor Beam Damage | 100 | 85 |
| Unibeam Cooldown | 12s | 14s |
| Arc Reactor Charge Rate | - | Reduced by 10% |

> **Developer Note**: Iron Man's long-range dominance was too strong, especially in high-rank matches where his pick rate and win rate were exceptionally high. These changes aim to bring him more in line with other Strategists.

### Spider-Man

Spider-Man's mobility has been enhanced to enable more aggressive playstyles:

- Web Swing movement speed increased by **10%**
- Web Shooter ammo increased from **6 → 8**
- Spider-Sense detection range expanded from **15m → 18m**

### Black Panther

- Vibranium Strike damage increased from **120 → 135**
- King's Grace cooldown reduced from **8s → 7s**
