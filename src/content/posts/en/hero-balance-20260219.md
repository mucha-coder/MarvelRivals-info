## 🦸 Hero Updates

### Elsa Bloodstone

Her ultimate ability, Glartrox, was proving too dominant with high survivability and duration.

- **Ultimate: Glartrox**
    - **Health Reduced**: 500 → **400**
    - **Dash Duration Reduced**: 6s → **3.5s**
    - **Grab Hitbox Reduced**: 6m(L)×6m(W)×3.5m(H) → **5m(L)×5m(W)×3.5m(H)**

These changes make Glartrox easier to counter and require more precise timing to use effectively.

### Hawkeye

Hawkeye's damage output was slightly too high across the board. Damage values have been tuned down to reward precision aiming more.

- **Piercing Arrow**
    - **Base Damage Reduced**: 34 → **28**
- **Fully Charged Shot**
    - **Base Damage Reduced**: 85 → **70**
    - **With Archer's Focus**: 175 → **160**

### Hela

To limit her dominance at extreme ranges, damage falloff has been increased.

- **Nightsword Thorn**
    - **Damage Falloff Increased**: Damage at 30m reduced from 80% → **70%** of base damage
    - **Critical Hit Threshold**: Beyond 25m, two critical hits will no longer secure a kill on a 250 HP target
